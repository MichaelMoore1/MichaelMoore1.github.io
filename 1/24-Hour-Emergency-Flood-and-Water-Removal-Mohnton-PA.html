<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

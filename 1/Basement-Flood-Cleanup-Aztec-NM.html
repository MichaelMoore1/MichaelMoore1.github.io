Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve.

<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Simple drying techniques are frequently inadequate when getting rid of water from areas it is not supposed to be. Your carpet, walls and floor coverings are porous which means a basic cleaning will not be sufficient and comprehensive water damage cleaning is needed.

<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any tough surface areas to get rid of the mold from the surface.

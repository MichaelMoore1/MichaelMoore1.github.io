<p>To get rid of soot and smoke from walls, furniture and floors, use a mild soap or cleaning agent or blend together 4 to 6 tbsp. tri-sodium phosphate and 1 cup family cleaner or chlorine bleach to every gallon of warm water.

<p>If a so-called mold expert insists that you need to spend numerous dollars on pre-testing when mold is currently noticeable, our guidance is to be very wary because it's often a waste of cash.

Fire damage, smoke damage, smoke odor, and fire soot residue left on a residential or commercial property and its contents can overwhelm property owner and company owner.<p>
<p>Many highly contagious health problems are linked to water damage including skin infections, liver disease A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's disease, along with blood, liver, and kidney problems. A few of the mold on the surface area may be eliminated but the roots of the mold are left intact indicating the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of duplicated lightening. Perhaps this is why some people believe that spraying bleach on mold does not impact it however rather just whitens its color so you can no longer see it.<p>

<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for indications of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that lawyers now allege originated from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little federal government and contractor oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>

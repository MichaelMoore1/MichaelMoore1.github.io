<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>

<p>As wetness is launched in the air, nature constantly tries to reach stability. Calculating the humidity is necessary in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity constantly takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the humidity increases, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every two to three spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>

<p>Mold loves to grow in your home's attic and crawl spaces, but what brought the mold in the very first place? The brief answer: darkness and the presence of wetness in the environment. Stone floorings need less time to change than water damaged hardwood floors. A complete floor replacement can be anticipated to be ended up in four to 10 days. Water damaged walls typically peel and may need both repair and repainting; the latter service requires a number of hours.<p>

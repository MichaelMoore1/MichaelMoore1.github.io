<p>11. Drywall and other kinds of wall products generally do not dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's usually best to rip them out to avoid mold, especially if they aren't totally dry within 48 hours. Like bleach, ammonia will eliminate mold on hard non-porous surfaces such as counter tops, glass or tiles however it is ineffective at killing mold growing in porous material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>Since black mold can form in the walls prior to infecting drywall or other surface areas, opportunities are that house owners might smell its moldy, mildew odor prior to seeing it. When you do begin your assessment, look for its particular slimy texture, dark green-black (often gray) color, and spotty look. When a storm strikes your Reston home or company, you need help instantly. Our fast reaction will help prevent secondary damage and help reduce restoration costs.<p>

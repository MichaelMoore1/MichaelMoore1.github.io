<p>Water damage develops from damaged pipes, blocked drains, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The proper treatment depends on the nature of the damage. Some water carries contaminants and should be thought about harmful. Whatever the origin, the prospects for restoration depend largely on the speed with which your building and personal effects can be dried.

These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size.

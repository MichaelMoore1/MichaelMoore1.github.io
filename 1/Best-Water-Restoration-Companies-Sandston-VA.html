These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue.

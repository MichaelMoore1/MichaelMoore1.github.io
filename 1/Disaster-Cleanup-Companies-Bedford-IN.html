<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.

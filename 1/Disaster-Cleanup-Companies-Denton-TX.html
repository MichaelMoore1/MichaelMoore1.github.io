<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling because of a dripping roofing system, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you stress and anxiety and aggravation, specifically if you've never ever done it previously. Mold requires simply 3 things to endure and grow: humidity, wetness and darkness. The most typical areas in your home for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, crawlspaces, ducts and carpets. The best way to avoid mold growth is to remove water leaks or wetness in your house. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention suggestions.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that involves a significant amount of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying may require unique approaches, longer drying times, or significant water vapor pressure differentials.</p>

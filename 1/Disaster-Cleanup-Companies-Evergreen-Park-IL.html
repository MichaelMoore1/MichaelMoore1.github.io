<h2>Water Damage in Evergreen Park - Cleaning and Drying</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most devastating things that can occur to a family or an individual. To begin addressing a water damaged wall or ceiling in your home, you need to determine the source of the water. It is possible for water to travel far from the site of the leak and trigger damage elsewhere, in unanticipated locations. Call a licensed plumbing to help you out if you aren't sure where the leakage is. Without determining the source of the water, the issue will resurface once again later on.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>The function of cleanup is to eliminate mold and remove polluted products. Eliminating mold with a biocide is insufficient, considering that proteins and chemicals triggering reactions in humans stay in dead mold. The following methods are used. As such, it is a type of water damage that insurer are likely to cover. Speak with your insurance coverage adjuster to ensure you're appropriately covered should a flood affect your property.<p>
<p>Do not attempt or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furnishings, draperies or other home textile items. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the material, making cleaning more difficult. Use a dry, absorbent cloth to wipe down the phone.

<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected sprawling rural houses, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties constructed with materials other than stucco had issues, too. Some homes with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local firms. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>

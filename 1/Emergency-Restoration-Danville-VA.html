<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Danville</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repair work, bear in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is finished.<p>

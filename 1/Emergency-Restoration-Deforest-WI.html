<p>Examine the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Remove all compromised drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to remove it. They might be repairable by cutting out the damaged part if drywall panels just reveal water stains but aren't structurally compromised. When cutting out around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

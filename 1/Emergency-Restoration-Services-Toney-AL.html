<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it wet can turn into a major headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag before drying out, fixing it may just need pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

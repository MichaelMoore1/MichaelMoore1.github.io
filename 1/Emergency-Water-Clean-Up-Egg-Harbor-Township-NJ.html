Look for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper).

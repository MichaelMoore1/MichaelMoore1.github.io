<h3>Fire And Flood Restoration Companies in Leonia</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>

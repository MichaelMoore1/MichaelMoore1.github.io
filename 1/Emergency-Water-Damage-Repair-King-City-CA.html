<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

Flood damage cleanup is major and need to be dealt with experts specifically when experience mud flood.</p>

<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence.

They returned every day (often twice a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>

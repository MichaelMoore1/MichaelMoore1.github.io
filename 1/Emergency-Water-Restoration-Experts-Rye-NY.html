To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the option on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water easily.

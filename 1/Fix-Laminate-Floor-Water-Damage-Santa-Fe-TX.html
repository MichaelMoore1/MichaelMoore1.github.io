If not, you might have to change the entire drywall panel.</p>
<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Santa Fe</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>

<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends disposing of products that have not been completely cleaned and dried within two days of water damage. Repair any leaks or underlying concerns immediately to help prevent mold development or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and outside of your home. Therefore, it is not possible to totally remove" all of the mold from within a building, as microscopic spores will still exist even after the problem has been dealt with.<p>
<p>Ducts can also involve a great deal of mold development due to moisture accumulation and condensation that can happen when filters aren't altered effectively or the HVAC system isn't properly vented and serviced. This is a costly job that involves scrubbing the interiors of the ducts and utilizing air scrubbers throughout the entire home. It can cost $4,000-$ 6,000 typically. Make plans for restoration crews to get rid of big furniture products from effected areas. Don't forget the china cabinet, home entertainment center, waterbeds, or aquariums.<p>

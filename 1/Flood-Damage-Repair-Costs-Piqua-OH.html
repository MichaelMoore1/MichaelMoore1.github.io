<p>We just recently had major water damage due to a cleaning machine overflow.

All surfaces impacted by water damage need to be completely dried, cleaned up, sanitized and ventilated by skilled and licensed water restoration professionals in order to get rid of disease-causing bacteria, fungi and other viruses before the location is safe for people once again. The actual cleaning and drying time of your contents is dependent upon the level of the water damage. While some clean-up efforts can take 2 days, many may take longer.</p>
<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke stains. This phase is essential, as these sponges utilize unique chemicals to raise discolorations from walls. Never utilize soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it difficult to remove with a chemical sponge. Begin cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always using a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas below. Or just get a new sponge. Make sure you utilize a wiping movement the whole time. If you scrub the spots, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>

Use the fabric on the musty area to eliminate the mold with the sodium bicarbonate and water service.<p>
<p>Then, if water has actually penetrated to the subfloor, we will continue water extraction there, and institute drying treatments for the subfloor using dehumidifiers and air movers. Then specialists will check your home for any extra structural damage. Expense assessments: In some cases it is more cost reliable to utilize less equipment over a somewhat longer time period. Sometimes it is more expense reliable to take longer to dry versus to repair and destroy.<p>

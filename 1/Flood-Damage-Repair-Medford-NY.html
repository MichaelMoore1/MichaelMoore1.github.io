<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>However you may not have the ability to get insurance to pay for your mold remediation costs if the damage is an outcome of your neglect-- for instance, if you have actually had a sluggish leak under your bathroom sink for several years and have actually overlooked the problem. If the insurer can identify that the mold damage is a result of your carelessness, they likely will not cover mold remediation costs. Your property owner's insurance coverage likely will not cover the loss if you do not have flood insurance coverage. If the flood has been declared a federal disaster by the President, request assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>

After doing tests for water and mold, he described the problems (leak in dishwashing machine plumbing triggering considerable water damage inside the cabinet) and what remediation efforts would be essential.

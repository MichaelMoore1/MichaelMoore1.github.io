<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>

If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health danger and should be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipelines, duct and electrical wiring.</p>

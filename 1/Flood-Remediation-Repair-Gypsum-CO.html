When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done effectively.

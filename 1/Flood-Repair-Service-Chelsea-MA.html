Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying project back days.

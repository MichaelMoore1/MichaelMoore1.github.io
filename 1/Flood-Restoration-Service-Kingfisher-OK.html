<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

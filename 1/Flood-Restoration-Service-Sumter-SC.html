<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Utilizing paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation process is thought about to finish.<p>

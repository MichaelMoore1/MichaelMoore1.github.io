<p>When you are preparing big repairs, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By decreasing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>

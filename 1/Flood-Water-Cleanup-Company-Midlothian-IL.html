<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach likewise gives off extreme fumes and it even produces poisonous gas when blended with ammonia. There are more secure options such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave hazardous residue. For these factors attempt to avoid utilizing bleach and if you need to utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

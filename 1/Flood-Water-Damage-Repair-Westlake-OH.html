All surfaces affected by water damage should be thoroughly cleaned, sanitized and deodorized by trained professionals in order to correctly get rid of disease-causing bacteria, fungi and other infections prior to the location is safe for people again.</p>
<p>Since common building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

Some products will take on more water than others, and some products can be more challenging to dry. Feel free to ask our service technicians everyday to reveal you the progress we are making in the drying process. We are accustomed to teaching interested customers about our process if it helps in reducing anxiety about challenging locations or the length of time the process will take.</p>

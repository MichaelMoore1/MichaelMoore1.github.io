<p>Health issues: White mold can trigger concerns such as eye irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, and respiratory concerns. When a mold problem becomes larger than 3 square feet or is difficult to clean, you should call an expert for mold remediation. Note: If you are fixing a wall that has actually been filled, it might be required to make a larger opening and change any wet insulation before you close up the wall.

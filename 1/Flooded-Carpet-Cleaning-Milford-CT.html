<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

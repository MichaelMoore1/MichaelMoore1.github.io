<p>It's not simply a catch phrase! As an in your area owned and operated business, we are prepared to react quickly and expediently with the right tools and understanding to finish the job FAST. After a heavy rain storm, a fast response is CRITICAL to minimizing potential secondary damages and costs to your Portland home or company. Drying out after water damage need to top any cleanup concern list.

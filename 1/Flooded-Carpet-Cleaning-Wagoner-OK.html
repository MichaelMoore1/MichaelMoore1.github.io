They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and also were extremely handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>

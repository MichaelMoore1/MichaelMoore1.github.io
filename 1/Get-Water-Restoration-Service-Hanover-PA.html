<p>Water damage can be the starting point for many serious problems that can impact a structure, damage personal property and present major health threats to residents. To restore property and secure health, an expert restoration specialist must thoroughly manage the task. They need to be educated in several disciplines, including stopping germs from spreading, avoiding mold growth, avoiding secondary damage, and saving the structure and its numerous contents. Furthermore, they must be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurance company agents with self-confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the perfect breeding location for mold, while poor indoor ventilation can cause molds to prosper. Wet building materials and humid indoor air are mold's friends.</p>

Any high degree of moisture, integrated with temperature and nutrients, develops the perfect environment for the fungal elements of mold and mildew to flourish. It is necessary to get rid of the source of the moisture to prevent the spread of mold contamination as soon as possible.</p>

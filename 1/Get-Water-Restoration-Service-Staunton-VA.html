<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke discolorations. This stage is essential, as these sponges use special chemicals to raise stains from walls. Never use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it difficult to get rid of with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces beneath. Or simply grab a new sponge. Make sure you utilize a cleaning motion the whole time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the discolorations.</p>

<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying since the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Really courteous and easy-going person.</p>

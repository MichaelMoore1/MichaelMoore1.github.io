<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a hazardous situation for property owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's experienced pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may result in a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and lack of sanitation up until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewage system can not operate properly (typical pipes problems in old homes ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater count on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to minimize the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (infections, germs and protozoa).

Molds is available in many different forms; in truth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are most likely 10s of thousands of types of molds, if not more. Molds play a crucial role in breaking down leaves, plants and trees.

The results will be more intense for those who dislike that mold or have asthma. Molds responsible for breaking down natural products, like wood and leaves, can damage the structure of your home.

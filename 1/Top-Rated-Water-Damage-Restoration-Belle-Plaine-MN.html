<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on walls and floors is another possible effect of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Musty odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have happened and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

And if a hard surface, such as stone, hardwood, or even brick, becomes saturated, you require a real expert on your side.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to address using bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Specialist Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical level of sensitivities specifically if used in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at removing mold than a damp fabric and a moderate detergent, so we advise the least poisonous alternative.</p>
<p>After cleaning any affected locations, industrial grade drying equipment will be established to dry your structure. If you reside in a colder climate, we might require to use additional heat to aid in drying. We might also require to use negative pressure to prevent odors from escaping into your living space.

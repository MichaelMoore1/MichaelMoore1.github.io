It's an unfortunate truth that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Probably the most common is the smashed screen, which we discuss in our article on getting a broken iPhone repaired But the second most typical is water damage. Parts of a water-damaged home may need to be restored. Materials like drywall and carpet that have actually absorbed water typically establish germs and mold that can't be gotten rid of. Changing these products is much safer than permitting infectious organisms to saturate the air.<p>

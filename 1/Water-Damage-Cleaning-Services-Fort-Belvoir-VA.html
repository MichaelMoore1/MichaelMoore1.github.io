<p>To buy time, place damp books and pictures into plastic bags and location in a frost-free freezer. This will stop extra deterioration, and avoid mold and mildew.

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to do the job appropriately. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Water and bacteria-growth damages can start within hours. Call for professional help. Mold remediation is the process of determining and getting rid of unhealthy levels of mold that have actually colonized in a home, workplace, school or other building. Over time, if unattended, mold can damage a home by breaking down cellulose-based products (like wood or ceiling tiles). and causing a sluggish and messy  decay. In the shorter term, a mold infestation can cause serious health issue.<p>

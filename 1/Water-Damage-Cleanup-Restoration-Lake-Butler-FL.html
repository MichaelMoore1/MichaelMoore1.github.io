<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, primarily causing respiratory issues. However in serious cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia.

<p>Daily moisture readings should be included in the drying record to consist of air, a/c, and equipment systems. Wetness content levels for damp structural materials ought to be recorded in a moisture content spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These recorded moisture content readings will show that the structure is back to an appropriate range of pre-loss condition. It is essential to understand that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being used or if changes are needed.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days.

<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Rosedale</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is finished.<p>

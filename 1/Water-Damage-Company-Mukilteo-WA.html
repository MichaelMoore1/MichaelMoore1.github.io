Part of our tracking process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days.

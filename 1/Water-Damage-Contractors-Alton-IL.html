This product acts like a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel turns through heated exhaust air, the wetness vaporizes (desorption) and is brought outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>

It is very important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being used or if adjustments are required.</p>

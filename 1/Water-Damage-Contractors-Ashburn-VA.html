Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process.

As soon as MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process.

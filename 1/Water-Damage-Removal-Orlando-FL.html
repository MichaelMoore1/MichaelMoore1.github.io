<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to five lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that clean it away with a moist towel. As with a few of the above techniques, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was basic: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to build faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>

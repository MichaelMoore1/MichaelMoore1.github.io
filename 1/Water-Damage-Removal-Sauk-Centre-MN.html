<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

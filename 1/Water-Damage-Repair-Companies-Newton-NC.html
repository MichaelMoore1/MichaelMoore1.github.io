You most likely still odor smoke smells, which can take a few days to a couple of weeks to dissipate. Take a look around the room, and recognize materials that can quickly soak up odor. You can put these items together in a separate space or outdoors to see if the smell dissipates after a couple of days; think about throwing out the products you can stand to part with. Getting your carpets expertly steam-cleamed can also assist with remaining smoke smells - very same goes with any upholstery, furnishings or curtains. Having these cleaned expertly will drastically minimize the smoke smell.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can get rid of water vapor from the air in an included location, like a bedroom or downstairs rec space.

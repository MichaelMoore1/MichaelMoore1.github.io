Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve.

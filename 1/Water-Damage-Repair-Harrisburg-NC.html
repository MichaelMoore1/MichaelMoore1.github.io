Contact a licensed plumbing professional to help you out if you aren't sure where the leakage is. Without determining the source of the water, the problem will resurface again later on.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice appropriate kitchen maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning.

Scrub mold from surfaces as soon as it appears, then make sure to dry the area to avoid it from spreading.</p>

These spores are tiny in nature and grow on moisture, spreading into colonies that produce irritants and allergens.

<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days.

Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Classifications of Water), and that will factor into the equation of what can be conserved and what must be replaced. We will deal with you throughout the loss, setting aside items that we feel can not be effectively restored so you can make a list to become your insurance coverage adjuster.

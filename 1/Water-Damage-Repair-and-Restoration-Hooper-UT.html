Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered how much water bill I was paying given that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very polite person.</p>

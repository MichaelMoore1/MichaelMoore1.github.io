Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

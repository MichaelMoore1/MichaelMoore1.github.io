<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke stains. This phase is important, as these sponges utilize unique chemicals to raise stains from walls.

When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas below. Or simply get a brand-new sponge. Make sure you utilize a cleaning motion the whole time.

<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a large brush, and bear in mind that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall might need to be removed and changed. If basement carpet has actually ended up being moldy, sweep it (while wearing a mask) to loosen the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to eliminate wetness if it's attached to the floor.</p>

<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal visible indications of wetness, dripping water, or signs of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may fall apart or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum product. Other times, you might see little signs like coffee-colored discolorations that may broaden with time.</p>
<p>Considerable smoke damage can leave your residential or commercial property stained and charred. It can stain ceilings and walls yellow and warp wood and plastic.

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every single 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout a number of days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>

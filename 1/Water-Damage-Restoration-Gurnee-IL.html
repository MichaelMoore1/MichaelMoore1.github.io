Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any circumstance, especially when the hot water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater is imminent unless fixed rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>

Visible mold colonies may form where ventilation is poorest and on boundary walls (due to the fact that they are nearest the dew point ).</p>

<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Water damage can permanently damage your home or organisation. The longer you wait, the greater the opportunities of mold causing health threats.

<p>Material Removal: Some products will need to be removed prior to the start of the cleaning process. Frequently, walls, cabinets, and ceilings near the source of the fire are beyond conserving. In these cases, our service technicians eliminate the products and dispose of them. We then start the fire restoration and fire cleaning process once we verify that all the non-salvageable materials have actually been eliminated.</p>
<p>In some cases water streams hidden down the inside of wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall. Unless water stains appear, this moisture might go undiscovered till molds and odor problems occur. This is one of the reasons a professional is equipped with the proper instruments to identify and find wet locations prior to the drying procedure starts.

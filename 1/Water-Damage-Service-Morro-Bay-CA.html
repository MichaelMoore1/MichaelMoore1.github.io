<p>Remediation professionals must disclose, in writing, when and how they are deviating from the ANSI requirement. This consists of if they do both screening and remediation, as that is considered a dispute of interest. We encourage that the conditions be examined pre- and post-remediation by an independent qualified expert and that a separate qualified remediation company perform the work. When not possible, the reason that should be specified (e.g. remote locations may not have both).<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other home disinfectants will not kill mold. Attempt to keep yourself, children, workers and others out of the affected area. Trying to dry the area with a fan may interrupt the spores and spread them to a new location.

Not only does it do a great job of showing you the damage that water can do to a RV, the creator also shows how to repair the damage step by action. Now this repair was carried out in 2011 to a Fleetwood Burglar 275N Fifth-wheel travel trailer, but the concepts still apply even if you have a motorhome or fiberglass exterior.</p>
<p>Unfavorable air devices, equipped with HEPA (high performance particle air filters") should be used to remove bacteria and other contaminants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage need to be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with correct waste holding tanks which should be disposed of correctly. Difficult surface areas that are impacted must be cleaned and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard ought to be removed and correctly dealt with. Any material that absorbs substantial amounts of moisture and can not be properly cleaned must be eliminated. As soon as infected materials have been gotten rid of, a 2nd application of sanitizers should be used to all work surfaces.</p>

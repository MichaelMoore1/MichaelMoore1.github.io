<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

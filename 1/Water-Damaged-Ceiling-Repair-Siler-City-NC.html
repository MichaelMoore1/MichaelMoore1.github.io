<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for visible mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>It just takes a little water leakage, and even excess humidity, for mold to form in your Cedar Falls home or business. Then, mold can spread out rapidly through the home in as low as 2 days. Mold can produce allergens and irritants, and it has the potential to cause other health effects. We can check and examine your residential or commercial property and utilize our specialized knowledge, training, and devices to remediate your mold invasion if your home or service has a mold issue.</p>

Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

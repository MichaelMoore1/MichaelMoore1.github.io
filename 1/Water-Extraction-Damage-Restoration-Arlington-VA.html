<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is one of the most destructive things that can occur to an individual or a family. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being completely changed. If there is minor damage then most of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may need repairing. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The sort of wood floor covering you might have determines and restricts the type of repair work that require to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader series of alternatives to repair the issue. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for specific planks. The best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>

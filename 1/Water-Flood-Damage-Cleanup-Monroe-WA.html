Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts.

This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>

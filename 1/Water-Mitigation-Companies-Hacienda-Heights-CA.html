Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

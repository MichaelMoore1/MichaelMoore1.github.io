Floor covering water damage can actually go undetected for a long time if the spot is located in the corners of a space or versus a wall. If you observe any warping of wood or vinyl 6 flooring, then the area is likely exposed. In addition, wet locations of carpet indicate water damage.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a major health risk. Nevertheless, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for visible mold growth (it might look cottony, velvety, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find indications of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<h3>Fire And Smoke Damage in Hillsboro</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repairs, bear in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>

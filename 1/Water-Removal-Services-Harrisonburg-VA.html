<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Harrisonburg - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and must be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

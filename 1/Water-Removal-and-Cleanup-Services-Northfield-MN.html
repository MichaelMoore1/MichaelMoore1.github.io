<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very polite individual.</p>

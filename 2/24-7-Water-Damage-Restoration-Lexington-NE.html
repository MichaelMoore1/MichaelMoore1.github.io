<h3>Why You Should Hire Lexington Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists generally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the service on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water easily. This might exacerbate the problem due to the fact that as you know - mold loves moist environments.<p>

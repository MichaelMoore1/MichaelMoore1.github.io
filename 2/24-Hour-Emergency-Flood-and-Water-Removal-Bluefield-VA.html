<p>Mold inspections search for proof of mold or mildew growth which shows a water or moisture problem.

<p>A great way to prevent mold from growing in your home is to reduce humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, inspect your home for leakages. Mop it up quickly and dry the location if water does enter your home. Also, try to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not raining, naturally) or placing fans in your room.

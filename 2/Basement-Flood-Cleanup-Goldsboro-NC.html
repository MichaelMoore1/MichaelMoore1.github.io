They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job properly.

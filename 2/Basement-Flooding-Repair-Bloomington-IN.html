<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration stage of the job, your skilled cleanup team will use the appropriate combination of cleaning representatives, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers. Making use of chem-sponges is important in this phase. A chem-sponge collects soot and particles when it enters contact with them. It also avoids streaking on surfaces and walls. Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned are very first cleaned up with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and deodorizing agent.

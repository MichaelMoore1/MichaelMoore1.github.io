<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold is a typical culprit of damage in a number of our houses and companies here in Central Illinois. When moisture is present, mold spores can spread out quickly. Often it can take hold in less than 48 hours after a wetness damage has happened.

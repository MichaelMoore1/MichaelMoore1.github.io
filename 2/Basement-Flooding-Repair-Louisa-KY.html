Always make sure you utilize an independent, third party testing company, and that if you use a mold remediation company, that they use a third party screening agency themselves. Testing agencies ought to not give any information on how to handle the issue, or charge you for remediation; they must only evaluate the mold and tell you what it is.<p>

Place water-permeable bundles of desiccants and wet products in airtight containers or in sealed areas, like closets. Some desiccants change color to suggest they are filled, which can take days or weeks, depending upon how much moisture items include.<p>

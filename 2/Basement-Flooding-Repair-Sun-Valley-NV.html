Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely harmful. We engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado when InstaScope was produced. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged expert on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was designated to validate and test the brand-new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other technique or gadget, can provide clinically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so immediately. So when you consider all the risks of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>

Additionally, they need to be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurance company agents with self-confidence and authority.

If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Lots of people swear by raw rice, recommending owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the things (cover it entirely) and leave it there for 2 days or two. A: Mold is a microscopic fungus that is part of the natural surroundings and required for our ecosystem. While it is necessary in the outside world, too much mold inside a structure can be unhygienic and unsafe. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores float through the air both inside and outside.<p>
<p>Smoke-damaged books and documents are usually discarded. IRS Restoration recovers paper products through a procedure of freeze drying to remove lingering smoke odors. Everything that came into contact with flood water will need to be disinfected. You need to dispose of any permeable materials it touched and make sure everything else is completely sanitized if the water contained sewage or other hazardous materials. Do this as soon as possible to prevent mold development.<p>

Confirm the presence of dead mold spores (which likewise trigger health problems).

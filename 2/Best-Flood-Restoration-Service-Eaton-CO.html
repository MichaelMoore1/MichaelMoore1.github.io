<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his guys were incredible in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were really helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>

<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall since mold and mildew can be a severe health hazard. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>

<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>

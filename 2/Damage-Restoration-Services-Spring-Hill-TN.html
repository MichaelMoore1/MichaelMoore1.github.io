<p>When you are planning big repairs, bear in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is essential to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is ended up.<p>

<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. An automatic shut-off valve is excellent insurance to have in any scenario, specifically when the water heater unit lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater looms unless fixed rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected.

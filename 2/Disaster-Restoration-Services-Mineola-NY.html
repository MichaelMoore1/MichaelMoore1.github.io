<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, quick air motion throughout damp surfaces of assemblies or products is an important component of efficiently and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or products. Rapid air motion across the surface area of material ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface moisture gives way to reducing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for changing conditions.</p>

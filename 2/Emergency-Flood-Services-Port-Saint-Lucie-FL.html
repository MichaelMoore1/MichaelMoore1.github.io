<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a harmful scenario for property owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's seasoned pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may cause a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and lack of sanitation till the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a personal sewage system can not function correctly (common pipes issues in old houses ).

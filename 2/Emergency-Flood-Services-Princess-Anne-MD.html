We get to your home or office quickly and strive to stop the spread of water, start drying, and work to restore the damage.</p>
<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke discolorations. This stage is vital, as these sponges use unique chemicals to raise discolorations from walls. Never ever use soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it impossible to remove with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always using a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas below. Or merely grab a brand-new sponge. Make sure you utilize a cleaning motion the entire time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the discolorations.</p>

<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

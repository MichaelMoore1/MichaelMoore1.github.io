Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being fully changed. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need repairing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor may require changing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The type of wood floor covering you may have limits the type and figures out of repairs that require to take place. Solid hardwood floor covering allows for a wider series of alternatives to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for private planks.

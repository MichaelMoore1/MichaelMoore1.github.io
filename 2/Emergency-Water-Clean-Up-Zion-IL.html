Once MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>

<h3>Insurance Claim Water Damage in Dudley Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Certain areas of your home such as crawl attics, spaces and basements are much more vulnerable to water damage. Dark, damp crawl spaces can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they grow. If there is moisture dripping through it, the concrete structure of your home can trigger dripping in the basement. Condensation in the location between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roofing system, which can result in mold and rotting. When inspecting your home for possible reasons for water damage make certain to look out for moisture in lighting fixtures in addition to the general condition of any noticeable piping.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>

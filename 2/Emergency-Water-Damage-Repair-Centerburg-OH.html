<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

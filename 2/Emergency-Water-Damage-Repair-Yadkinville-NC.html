<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very respectful individual.</p>

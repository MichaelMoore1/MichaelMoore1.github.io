Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

We dried the carpet and pad in location and utilized HEPA air scrubbers to keep the air clean throughout the process. Restoration was unneeded due to the fact that of our drying strategies and devices.</p>

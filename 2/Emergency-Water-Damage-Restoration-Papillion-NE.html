<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show noticeable indications of moisture, dripping water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may collapse or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you may observe little indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand with time.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

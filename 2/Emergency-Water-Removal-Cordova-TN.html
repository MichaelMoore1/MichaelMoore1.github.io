<p>Every water damage event is a little bit different and requires a distinct service, however the general process remains the same. The steps listed below highlight our procedure for the common" water damage emergency. There are unusual circumstances where testing may be valuable. For some circumstances, testing might confirm mold development or document clean-up has fulfilled expectations. In these cases it is necessary to utilize a knowledgeable investigator who will translate the outcomes for you and help you reach a decision. Evaluating should never be a substitute for a good visual assessment.<p>
<p>Eliminating one of the 3 requirements for mold lowers (or eliminates) new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for example, dust or dander ); and warmth because mold typically does not grow in cold environments. I had a great experience working with the group at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were professional, prompt and really communicative! I would certainly recommend for any mitigation or restoration work you require.<p>
<p>A solution of detergent and warm water can be used to scrub surface mold off non-porous surfaces. Although cleaning agent itself does not eliminate mold, if the mold is on non-porous products then the solution doesn't require to eliminate it as long as you entirely clean away all the mold on the surface. Using a pump sprayer, mist the surface areas with water to control the spread of spores, and roll up the sections. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>

Never use soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it difficult to get rid of with a chemical sponge. Begin cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always utilizing a clean surface area.

<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can occur on its own if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier creates the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical tourist attraction instead of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a product that attracts and holds wetness. This material acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through warmed exhaust air, the moisture vaporizes (desorption) and is carried outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

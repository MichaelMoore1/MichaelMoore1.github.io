Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

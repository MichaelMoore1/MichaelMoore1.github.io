<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Leechburg</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and must be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

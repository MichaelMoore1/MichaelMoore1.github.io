<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, mainly triggering respiratory issues. But in serious cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can cause pneumonia. When you suspect a mold invasion, you may wish to purchase a mold testing kit to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and hire a professional to help with removal.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Point Pleasant</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repair work, bear in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>

<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your home and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were really practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.

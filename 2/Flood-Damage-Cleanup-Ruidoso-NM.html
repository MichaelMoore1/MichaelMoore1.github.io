They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.

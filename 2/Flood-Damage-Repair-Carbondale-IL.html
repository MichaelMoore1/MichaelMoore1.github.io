<p>Basements are really common areas for mold to take hold and grow. They tend to get damp, that makes the perfect conditions for growing mold in corners and on walls and floorings.

<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Action online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, but whatever they did for me was fantastic. They finest feature of First Reaction was that they had the ability to handle my insurance provider when they were providing me problems. This probably assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and handled the concern for me, which was a big relief. They were extremely expert, and I liked everybody I handled from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were dealt with to my complete satisfaction. I would use them again.<p>
<p>To kill mold: Use white distilled vinegar and put it into a spray bottle without watering it down. Spray the vinegar onto the musty surface and leave it to sit for an hour. Lastly, wipe the location clean with water and allow the surface to dry. Any smell from the vinegar need to clear within a few hours. Whether or not you want to file a claim may depend on your estimated expenses, your deductible, and your specific policy. Fischer advises that you review your specific policy, and reach out to your insurance provider as early as possible in the process so you can get the very best guidance on whether or not and when to submit an actual claim.<p>

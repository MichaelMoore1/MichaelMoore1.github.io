Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season.

<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a harmful circumstance for property owners, according to Pipes 2.0's seasoned pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may cause a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and lack of sanitation up until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewer system can not function correctly (common pipes problems in old houses ).

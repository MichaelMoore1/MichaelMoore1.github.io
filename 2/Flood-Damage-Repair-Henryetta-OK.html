Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing numerous problems due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, houses, condos, townhouses, hotels, business buildings are particularly susceptible to these concerns as typically the builder farms out the outside envelope work and wall assembly process, for that reason resulting in corners and expenses being cut.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite individual.</p>

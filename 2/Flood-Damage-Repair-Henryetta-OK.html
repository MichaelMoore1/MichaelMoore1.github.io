<p>Current Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite individual.</p>

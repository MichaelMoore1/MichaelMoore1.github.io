<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health risk and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and cracked chimney can often allow rain during the colder months which can leak through the walls. In time, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into an unloved and exhausted  space.<p>

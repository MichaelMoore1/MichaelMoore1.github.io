<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

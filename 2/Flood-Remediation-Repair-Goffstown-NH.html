Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

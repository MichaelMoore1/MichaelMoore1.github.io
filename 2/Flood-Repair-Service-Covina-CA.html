<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Negative air makers, equipped with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air filters") must be made use of to remove bacteria and other pollutants from the air throughout restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with appropriate waste holding tanks which should be gotten rid of properly. Hard surface areas that are impacted need to be cleaned and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, rug, plaster wallboard must be eliminated and appropriately gotten rid of. Any material that takes in significant amounts of moisture and can not be adequately cleaned up must be removed. When contaminated materials have actually been removed, a second application of sanitizers need to be applied to all work surfaces.</p>

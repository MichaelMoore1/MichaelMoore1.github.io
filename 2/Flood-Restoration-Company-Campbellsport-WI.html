<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold growths (nests) can develop within 24-48 hours, so it is essential to act immediately if you have a water spill or leak-- especially if you live in a hot or damp  environment.

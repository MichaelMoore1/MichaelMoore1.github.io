<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size.

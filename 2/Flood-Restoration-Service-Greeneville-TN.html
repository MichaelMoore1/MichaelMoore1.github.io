<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Greeneville - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health risk and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

These systems can be utilized while work is being finished without any damage to technicians or homeowners. We set these units up on the first day and permit them to run for the entire project. Frequently, the unit will be set closest to the cause of the fire to be most efficient.<p>

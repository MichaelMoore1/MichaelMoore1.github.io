<p>When you are planning large repairs, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.

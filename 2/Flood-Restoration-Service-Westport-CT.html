<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache since the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply starts to sag before drying out, repairing it may just require pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

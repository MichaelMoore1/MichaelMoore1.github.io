<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in New Paltz</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and should be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Dry thoroughly and rapidly. If the energies are on, utilize the air conditioning or heating unit, fans, and a dehumidifier or desiccants to speed drying. For most kinds of home repair, it's best to take your time and consider your options before you commit to a certain company's services. However, water damage can destroy parts of your home within hours, and if you leave parts of your house damp for a week or more, you might have to evacuate to prevent health threats.<p>

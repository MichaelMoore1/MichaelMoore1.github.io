<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air motion throughout wet surface areas of assemblies or products is an important component of efficiently and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials.

The continuous and falling rates of drying materials require various requirements for altering conditions.</p>

You might try vacuuming around the phone's cracks and openings to draw more water out if the phone was totally immersed. When the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is vital to avoid recontamination. You should seal and right away dispose of materials that might have contact with mold, like your mask.

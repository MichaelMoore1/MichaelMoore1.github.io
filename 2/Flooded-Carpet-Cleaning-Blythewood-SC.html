<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or organisation can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>

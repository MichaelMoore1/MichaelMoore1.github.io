<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts right away begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really costly paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>

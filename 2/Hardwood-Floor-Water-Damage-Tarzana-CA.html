<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.

As a result, water mitigators understand the value of a fast action. In basic, the time it takes to mitigate a residential or commercial property depends on how severe the water damage is.<p>

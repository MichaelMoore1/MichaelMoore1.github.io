<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying since the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Very courteous and easy-going person.</p>

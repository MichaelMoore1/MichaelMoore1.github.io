<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Laurel</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists normally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This might worsen the issue due to the fact that as you understand - mold loves moist environments.<p>

<p>Specific sections of your home such as crawl basements, spaces and attics are far more prone to water damage. Dark, damp crawl spaces can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they flourish. The concrete foundation of your home can cause leaking in the basement if there is moisture leaking through it. Condensation in the location in between the attic and your home can trigger moisture on the underside of the roof, which can result in mold and rotting.

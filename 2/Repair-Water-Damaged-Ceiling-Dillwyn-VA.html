If the mold is considered to have come from water damage, some insurers might make you file a second claim of water damage instead, needing you to pay another deductible before remediation occurs.</p>

You can wipe them off then you may seal the wood surface areas with a wood primer. This will bring back the surface area or the wood to a better condition.

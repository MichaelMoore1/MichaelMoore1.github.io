<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his men were incredible in assisting us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often two times a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were really useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>

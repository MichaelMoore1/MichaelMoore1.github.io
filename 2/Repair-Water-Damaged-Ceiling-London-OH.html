<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were incredible in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the method and also were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>

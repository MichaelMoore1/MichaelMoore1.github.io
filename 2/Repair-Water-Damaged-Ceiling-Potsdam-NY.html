Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to droop prior to drying out, repairing it may just need pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

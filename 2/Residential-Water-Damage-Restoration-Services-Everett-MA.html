<p>Last but not least, we wish to resolve the use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Professional Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical level of sensitivities especially if used in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more effective at eliminating mold than a wet cloth and a moderate detergent, so we advise the least harmful alternative.</p>

Hydrogen peroxide is an excellent alternative to chlorine bleach since it is safe to utilize and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave behind hazardous residue or produce harmful fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>

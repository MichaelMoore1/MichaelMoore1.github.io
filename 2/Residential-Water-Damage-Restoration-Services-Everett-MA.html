<p>Last but not least, we wish to resolve the use of bleach on mold.

Hydrogen peroxide is an excellent alternative to chlorine bleach since it is safe to utilize and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave behind hazardous residue or produce harmful fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>

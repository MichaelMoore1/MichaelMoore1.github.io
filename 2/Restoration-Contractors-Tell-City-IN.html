Search for indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Not to make complex the matter, but to include some clarity to the problem of mold, mold spores threaten. They are dangerous whether dead or alive. So mold removal is various than mold cleaning.

A complete mold remediation and stain removal should be carried out to insure a safe, indoor air environment.</p>

<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's utilized on as it is an extreme, corrosive chemical.

<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

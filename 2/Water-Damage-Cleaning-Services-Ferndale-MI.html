Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>

<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>

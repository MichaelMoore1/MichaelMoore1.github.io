<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply starts to sag before drying out, fixing it might just require pushing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are great for drying in hard to reach areas-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and cushioning.

<p>Recent Review: A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water build-up. Colby and Caleb got here on the scene within a couple of hours and continued to drain pipes the location before any damage was done to my home.

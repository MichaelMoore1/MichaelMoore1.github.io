<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications.</p>

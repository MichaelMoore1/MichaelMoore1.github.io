Particular practices make this worse, such as enabling the phone to dry by itself. Letting water sit in the phone causes corrosion of its circuits, resistors and coils due to minerals in the water.<p>
<p>Utilize a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, due to the fact that it could mistakenly press liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You may attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out if the phone was completely immersed. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is important to avoid recontamination. You need to seal and right away get rid of materials that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the shoes or boots you used while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>

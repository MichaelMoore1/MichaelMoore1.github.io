Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

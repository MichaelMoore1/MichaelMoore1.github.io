<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that lawyers now declare came from pressure to develop faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and contractor oversight.

<p>Jake (and his group) are remarkable to work with. They fasted to respond at first and provided a affordable and reasonable quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule immediately and get the work done extremely quickly. Our mold issue ended up being smaller than very first thought so the last invoice reflected the actual work needed and was less than very first quoted. Jake was really responsive to calls and e-mails responding to concerns throughout the procedure. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really respectful person.</p>

Floor covering is tough to conserve, especially when flooded with infected water like river water or sewage system water.

To prevent mold in the bathroom, make sure to open windows if you have them to enhance ventilation and run the fan when showering, cleaning or shaving. Wipe water off hard surface areas, like shower walls and sinks, and repair plumbing leaks as soon as possible. Scrub mold from surface areas as soon as it appears, then make certain to dry the area to avoid it from spreading out.<p>

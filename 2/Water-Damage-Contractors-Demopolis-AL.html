<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>

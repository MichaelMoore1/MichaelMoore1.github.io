<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. As soon as this flammable fuel - drywall, furnishings, or carpet - has actually been heated to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unpredictable gases will be launched in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger lasting damage and should be dealt with by skilled experts, heat is the most obvious, and devastating, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire enters into contact with extra fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and steady wear and tear of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you combine electricity, water, oxygen and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no dependable timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components typically start rusting immediately after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can work generally for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of a problem. How quickly the rust process takes depends on a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and the length of time the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>

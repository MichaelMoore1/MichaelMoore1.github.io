<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Taylorsville</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

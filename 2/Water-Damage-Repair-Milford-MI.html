<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>

<h3>Smoke Damage Repair in Milford</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls.

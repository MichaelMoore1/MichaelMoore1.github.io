<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include browsing a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

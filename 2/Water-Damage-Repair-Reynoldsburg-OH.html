<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth discovering. Once the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>

Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a 2nd layer of joint substance to complete the repair.

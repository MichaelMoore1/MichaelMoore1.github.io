<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to develop much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and home builder oversight. Contribute to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average yearly rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>

There are also mold remediation professionals that specialize in cleaning and removing mold.

The two most significant offenders for water damage in homes are cleaning devices and hot water tanks.<p>

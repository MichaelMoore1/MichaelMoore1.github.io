The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>

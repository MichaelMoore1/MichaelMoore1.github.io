<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>

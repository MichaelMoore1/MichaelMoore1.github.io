<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the place the spores land is damp and great, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you actually wish to prevent purchasing a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this option and clean it straight over mold growth. Let the option sit for approximately 10 minutes, and after that scrub the area with a small brush or toothbrush. Wipe any staying mold away with a towel and let the location dry.</p>

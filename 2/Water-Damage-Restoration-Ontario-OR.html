<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

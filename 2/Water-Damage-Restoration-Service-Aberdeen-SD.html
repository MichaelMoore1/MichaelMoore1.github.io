<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely devastating. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence.

They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health risk, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Current Review: A pipe burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water accumulation. Colby and Caleb got here on the scene within a couple of hours and continued to drain the area before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed new insulation in the location. They supplied exceptional, effective, and professional service in addition to being enjoyable and friendly to work with. I wholeheartedly advise Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them again must the need arise.</p>

While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause enduring damage and ought to be dealt with by skilled specialists, heat is the most obvious, and damaging, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - implying that as a fire enters contact with extra fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>

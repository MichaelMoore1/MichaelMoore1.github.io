<p>Due to the fact that common building products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

Other times, you might observe little signs like coffee-colored spots that may expand with time.</p>

There is no reliable timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components typically begin corroding instantly after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can operate normally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of a problem. How quick the rust procedure takes depends on a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>

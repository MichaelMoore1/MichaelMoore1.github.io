<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Novato</h3>
<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Action online, and they were out within the hour. It was a severe experience, however whatever they provided for me was fantastic. When they were offering me problems, they finest thing about First Action was that they were able to manage my insurance coverage company. This most likely assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the problem for me, which was a big relief. They were extremely professional, and I liked everybody I handled from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were dealt with to my complete satisfaction. I would use them once again.<p>
<p>After the flood waters decline and the clean up has been done, many folks want to get back into their companies or houses and begin rebuilding. The issue is that wood that has actually been immersed in water has likely taken in a large quantity of water. Reconstructing too quickly after a flood can cause continuing problems such as mold development, insect problems, and degeneration of the wood and wall coverings.<p>

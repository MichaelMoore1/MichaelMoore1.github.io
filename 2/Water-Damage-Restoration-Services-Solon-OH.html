<p>Because typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

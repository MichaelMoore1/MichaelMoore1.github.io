The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to do the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

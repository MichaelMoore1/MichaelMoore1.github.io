<p>Basements are very common areas for mold to take hold and grow. They tend to get damp, which makes the best conditions for growing mold in corners and on floorings and walls.

Clean up includes scrubbing down the affected areas, utilizing dehumidifiers to dry out the space, and air scrubbers to help remove spores.</p>

<h3>Smoke Damage Repair in Matawan</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals normally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This could exacerbate the issue because as you know - mold loves wet environments.<p>

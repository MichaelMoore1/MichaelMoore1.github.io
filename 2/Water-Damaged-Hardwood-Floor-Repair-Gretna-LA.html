<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Gretna - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is essential to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>

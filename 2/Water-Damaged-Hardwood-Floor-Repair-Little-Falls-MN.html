<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The very best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the existence of a mold problem needing action and the extent of damage then composes a clear scope of work including appropriate requirements. This document needs to clearly explain the actions that will be followed by the remediation specialist, for example how the affected location will be included or what the confirmation requirements are. Without a clear arrangement in writing the conclusions, data, measurements are delegated the interpretation of each party.</p>

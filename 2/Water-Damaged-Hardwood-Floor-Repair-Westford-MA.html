<p>BRAVO - job well done! Found a flood at home in San Francisco - water had actually been over streaming a second floor sink for 15 hours. Called Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of devices to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were set up, heating pads were placed on hardwood ceilings, walls and floors were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes set up. Exceptional, professional care. Really pleased with their swift delivery of emergency service AND their attention to information to ensure the water damage was dried totally.</p>

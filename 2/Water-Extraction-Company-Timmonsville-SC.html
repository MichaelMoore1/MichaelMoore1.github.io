<p>Mold that is growing on basement walls or other surface areas might be scrubbed with one part bleach to 8 parts water. Mold is a kind of intrusive fungis that might grow on surfaces inside your home. It varies in color and type, and is normally found in areas that have actually been subjected to moisture at some point in time, such as bathrooms or in locations around leaking pipelines. Before you begin a project like this, offer the water damaged area a great clean. This is the textbook initial step in any paint task, including fixing water damage on walls. We advise using something like a Selleys Sugar Soap with a wet fabric and after that allowing time for the area to dry.<p>

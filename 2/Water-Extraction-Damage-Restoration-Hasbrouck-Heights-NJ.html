<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to preserve the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can acquire gadgets to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores.

<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your home and started drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>

Once the source of water is determined you will need to take actions to treat the problem and seal the leakage. When we got the emergency water-damage call for this flooded office structure, bales Restoration was ready. One of the flexible lines from the A/C system on the fourth floor stopped working and drained the system.<p>
<p>Corroded pipes are a typical incident after prolonged exposure to flood water. The corrosion makes them more likely to leakage or crack.

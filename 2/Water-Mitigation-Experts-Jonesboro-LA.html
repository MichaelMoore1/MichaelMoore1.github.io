<p>While the iPhone 7 and later are waterproof, it does not stop water from getting into the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later on have a similar concern, although they include an integrated feature that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a specific frequency. The worst issue with mold is that it has the possible to cause health results. Mold can set off allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some people dislike mold. As mold needs water to grow it is very important to avoid wetness and humidity issues in buildings, especially ones affected by water.<p>

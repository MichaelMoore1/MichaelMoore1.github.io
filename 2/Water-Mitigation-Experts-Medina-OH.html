<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water intrusion, constructing envelope issues, and building flaws are a very severe matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing many issues due to dripping windows and doors, water and wind driven rain damage.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of home damage that a family or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really costly paperweight.</p>

<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Oak Grove</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp.

If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

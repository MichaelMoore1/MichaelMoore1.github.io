Water invasion where wet, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where products described as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in very little wetness.</p>
<p>Mold and mildew are types of fungi that rapidly reach critical mass wherever wetness is present inside. This can result from any number of scenarios such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a damaged pipeline, or even a malfunctioning HVAC system - all of which can result in trouble. Any high degree of moisture, combined with temperature level and nutrients, produces the ideal environment for the fungal elements of mold and mildew to thrive. It is very important to eliminate the source of the wetness to prevent the spread of mold contamination as quickly as possible.</p>
